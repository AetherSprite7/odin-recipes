<h4>Best modern Mercedes v8's Ranked from worst to best!!!!!</h4>

<article class="centerthis">
    <p>M278 - M278 can grenade at any moment due to cylinder wall scoring and valvetrain wear caused by a shitty turbocharger design. It's not even a hot-v design yet here we are.</p>
 <p>M157 - M157 is basically a larger AMG tuned M278, it shares many of it's issues.</p>
    <p>M156 - M156 has shitty quality metal in the camshafts, lifters, headbolts, and cam adjusters, leading to premature failure of all.</p>
<p>M273 - M273 had shit quality metal used in it's idler sprockets for the first year of production. It also has a shitty air intake design, causing air/fuel mix issues if it fails. Cam adjusters can also fail. And the cherry on top, some engines have defective main bearings, creating a loud thumping sound on startup. Despite all this, M273 is pretty reliable.</p>
<p>M177 - M177 is actually good, no major design flaws other than coilpack failure and idle issues. The hot-v setup may cause premature degredation of plastic/electrical components in the engine. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKaKeEizu5I">Just dont drive in heavy rain.</a></p>
<p>M113/k - Very dependable but old, simple, and innefficient. Lifter wear and oil leaks are the biggest issues, along with rought idle and vacuum leaks.</p>
